## Course descriptions
Programming has become one of the *essential literacy* in recent years. While not each student, especially a literature/English major, is required to be a programming expert, a basic understanding of computational thinking would benefit undergraduates from all fields.

In this course, we pick front-end development as our entry point to the vast possibilities of programming. We will introduce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The most important reason for this is they provide immediate feedback, which is helpful for beginners. Secondly, the potential applicability is no doubt: a web page is still the most frequently-used way to communicate ideas, and many human-computer interactions still happen on web pages. Thirdly, although primarily used in web pages, JavaScript has become more and more omnipotent in every aspect. With the introduction of NodeJS, it gains significant traction on server back-end or general-purpose programming. Moreover, JavaScript is a great language. Although it starts as a front-end scripting language, it learns a lot from other successful paradigms. 

This course will gradually introduce how computers talk about things in the context of HTML and how to change their appearances (states) with CSS. Afterward, we will cover basic programming concepts, such as variables, conditionals, loops, data structures, modules, etc. The course is organized as an one-hour lecture and an one-hour hand-on lab session. Students are expected to follow the course requirements, including participation, assignments, mid-term exams and a final project.

## Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, students will know how to build a complete web page and have a basic understanding on programming and JavaScript.

The course also serves as a window through which students can find their way into more advanced and interesting aspects of programming.
